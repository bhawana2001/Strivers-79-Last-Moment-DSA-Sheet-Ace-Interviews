# Striver DSA-79 Sheet Solutions 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to solving the Striver DSA-79 sheet problems. In this repository, I will be posting solutions to the problems from the Striver's Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) 79-sheet, a popular resource for mastering data structures and algorithm.

## About the Striver DSA-79 Sheet 📘

The Striver DSA-79 sheet is a comprehensive collection of 79 handpicked coding problems designed to enhance your skills in data structures and algorithms. It covers a wide range of topics, including arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more. Each problem is carefully curated to help you build a strong foundation in DSA.

You can access the Striver DSA-79 sheet [here](https://takeuforward.org/interview-sheets/strivers-79-last-moment-dsa-sheet-ace-interviews/) 📑

## Repository Structure 📂

This repository is organized in a way that makes it easy for you to access the solutions and problem statements:

- Each problem solution is placed in its own directory under the `solutions` folder.
- Inside each solution directory, you will find the source code file containing the solution and a `README.md` file.
- The `README.md` file within each solution directory provides a link to the original problem statement.

## Daily Updates 📅

I am committed to posting solutions to one Striver DSA-79 sheet problem daily. You can track my progress by checking the commits and the "Daily Solutions" section below.
